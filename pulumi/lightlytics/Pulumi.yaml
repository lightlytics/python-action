# Notes:
# When your Pulumi program references resources in the local filesystem, they are always relative to the working directory.

# Stack Settings Files
# Each stack that is created in a project will have a file named Pulumi.<stackname>.yaml which contains the configuration specific to this stack.
# For example: Pulumi.prod.yaml
